# HeliumOS - made for big screens
An iPad version of Helium, OS designed for big TVs.

HeliumOS is a concept operating system created for collecting games, music, movies and apps. Designed for speed and user-friendliness. HeliumOS was created in my head back in 2017, originally meant to be tablet OS. Later I redesigned it to work and look stunning on bigger screens. Thanks to responsive UI, HeliumOS is great for resolutions bigger than 10'.
It's my first attempt to create an app with SwiftUI.

Designed, prototyped and coded by me.
